        <h1>Flower Power</h1>
        <p class="description">A fun and interactive site where a user creates their own flower compostion with a move of their mouse. 
            For this project, I was inspired by all of the flowers I saw in the city, during one of my most favorite seasons of the year, spring. 
            Flowers hold so much cultural and emotional value, that I could not go resist to make a creative website with all kinds of flowers I saw in New York City.

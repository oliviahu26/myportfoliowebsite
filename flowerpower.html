      <h1>Flower Power</h1>
      A fun and interactive site where a user creates their own flower
      compostion with a move of their mouse. For this project, I was inspired by
      all of the flowers I saw in the city, during one of my most favorite
      seasons of the year, spring. Flowers hold so much cultural and emotional
      value, that I could not go resist to make a creative website with all
      kinds of flowers I saw in New York City.
